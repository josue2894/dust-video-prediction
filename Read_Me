The following codes are on Jupiter Notebook using python3. 

1.) split_video2frames.ipynb 
2.) image_histogram.ipynb
3.) Pre_Processing_Scaled.ipynb	
4.) Dust_2.ipynb	
5.) Post_Processing.ipynb		
6.) Prediction_output.ipynb	


1.) split_video2frames.ipynb 
This code is used to go through video directory and split videos into frames. Note that frame rate is set to 5 frames per second but due to AVI format video will split into 10 frames per second. 

2.) image_histogram.ipynb
This code is used to take an input image and display a histogram. Program is set to compare RGB and HSV images for both dust and non_dust images. 

3.) Pre_Processing_Scaled.ipynb
This code is used to take in frames and extract bands to form a data frame for both RGB and HSV colorspace. 
 
4.) Dust_2.ipynb	
This code is used to take in a data frame and train a feed forward neural network. 6 directories will be created; biases, confusion_matrix, miss, summary, weights for training cycle and validation directory with validation confusion matrix.

5.) Post_Processing.ipynb		
This code is used to take confusion_matrix directory and create a plot for accuracy vs iteration. An over all report is also created showing accuracy, recall, precision for an index where accuracy was maximized. 

6.) Prediction_output.ipynb	
This code is used to predict frames with the best model weights and biases producing a text time with date and time of dust events. For the time being validation images are used.
